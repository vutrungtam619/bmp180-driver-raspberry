This is driver support for module sensor BMP180 by BOSCH

# SENSOR BMP180
- The BMP180 consists of a piezo-resistive sensor, an analog to digital converter and a control unit
with E2PROM and a serial I2C interface. The BMP180 delivers the uncompensated value of pressure
and temperature. The E2PROM has stored 176 bit of individual calibration data. This is used to
compensate offset, temperature dependence and other parameters of the sensor.
